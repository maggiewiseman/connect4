# Connect4

<a href="https://maggie-wiseman-portfolio.herokuapp.com/connect4/">See it here!</a>

I built a Connect 4 game for 2 players (not against the computer). Hover above the game board to choose a column and then click. This will add a pawn to the selected column and switch players. Making the slide animation and checking for diagonal wins was the most difficult part of this assignment.

## Skills/Concepts Used

* css tricks using transparent div with background shadow so that the pawn appears to drop through the gameboard.
* jQuery animation and jQuery UI effects for sliding and explode animation
* MVC structured code with gameboard model
* each white circle is associated with a cell object in the model
* used .prototype to add methods to each instance of a cell object in the model
